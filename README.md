## Data Notes
Data selected pertained to civilian complaints against NYPD from 1985 to January 2020.
Over 33,000 rows of raw data, some missing data related to race and sex, multiple officers had 0 as their shield number as well.
Data obtained from [propublica](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers) and there is additional information at the link provided. 

## Notes on semi clean data
The purpose of this file was to start experimenting in Tableau and develop ideas for visuals and presentations.
There are over 4000 nulls in important categories, but will take me time to deal with them. 
so for semi_clean_data I removed duplicates and all nulls just to start Tablea dashboard, 
All abbreviations are replaced with full form,
Dates added for complaint date and resolved date
filtered for age 10 and over - removed only 20ish rows.

## Project goals
1. Apply EDA best practices
2. Use best practices for coding in Python 
3. Identify a problem to develop into a Tableau dashboard
4. Practice pulling and pushing to github and hopefully avoid errors
5.
